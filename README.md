## Objective

To express an effective solution for this elevator problem, partially with code and more importantly with comments as time allowed.

## Character of the Expression

This is a Javascript solution that looks very much like a Java application.  On the backend, I tend to keep with best practices
for that area.  POJOs and simple services are still easy to use, even in Javscript.  I can easily change my coding style, but
this is my default.

I can also write this in:
 * React 
 * Other Javascript libs/patterns including vanilla Javascript)
 * Java
 * C#
 * Python

## To Improve

 * The solution is still premature
 * Tests
 * Linting
 * Public / useful API
 * An actual build/run stack
 * CLI runner / Web App / meaningful interface
 * Better formatting for the comments.  I went too fast trying to get more content
